# app-style-web-setup
A template for setting up a web page for an app style user experience. I define this as follows:

* A full screen page that remains full screen and never scrolls. 
* The ability to size items relative to the size of the screen.
* Default touch to scroll and reload are disabled. 
* Default select text with mousedown disabled.
